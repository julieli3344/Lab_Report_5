**A response from a TA(prented to be one) of what to try to fix error**
TA Response: for this kind of error, maybe try looking at the line decribed in the symptom to see where the error starts. Since you have written the test cases for reversed, try looking at the code in reversed and see what went wrong. 


**Another screenshot of trying the command and description of error**
I tried to follow the advice of the TA by looking at the reversed code to see what went wrong. The error was indeed within the code, and it was because the for loop was wrong, it should have been `array.length / 2` and the variable was set to the wrong thing.

**info needed about setup(file and directory structure | contents of each file before fixing bug | full command line to run bug | decription of what to edit to fix bug)**


Reflection
During the second half of this class I have learned many things that were new to me. I have never heard of vim before, and after using it during a lab, it was extremely useful and easier to edit text.
